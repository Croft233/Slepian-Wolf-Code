# Slepian-Wolf Code

This repository contains the reproduct code for Slepian-Wolf Code.

## Overview

**Objective:**  
- To develop a clear understanding of Slepian-Wolf coding principles and LDPC encoding/decoding techniques.
- To implement an LDPC-based Slepian-Wolf coding scheme, simulate its performance, and analyze how closely it can approach the Slepian-Wolf bound.

**Key Topics:**
- **Slepian-Wolf Coding:**  
  A method for separately encoding correlated sources with joint decoding, enabling efficient compression without inter-encoder communication.
- **LDPC Codes:**  
  Advanced error-correcting codes characterized by a sparse parity-check matrix. The research covers both the encoding (using approximate lower triangular forms) and decoding (via the sum-product algorithm) aspects.
- **Integration of Techniques:**  
  The study demonstrates how a single systematic channel code can be partitioned and combined with LDPC methods to meet the Slepian-Wolf theoretical limits.
