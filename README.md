# Slepian-Wolf Code

This repository contains a research study on Slepian-Wolf coding for correlated sources. 
The focus is on understanding the theoretical foundations and principles behind Slepian-Wolf codes, which enable separate encoding of correlated sources with joint decoding to approach the limits of data compression.

## Overview

- **Slepian-Wolf Coding:**  
  A coding scheme that allows the efficient compression of correlated sources by separately encoding them and jointly decoding without the need for communication between encoders.
  This study covers the Slepian-Wolf theorem and its achievable rate region :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

- **Objectives:**  
  - To explore the theoretical limits of Slepian-Wolf coding.
  - To understand the design and performance of Slepian-Wolf codes in scenarios with correlated data sources.

- **Applications:**  
  Potential use cases include sensor networks, multimedia communication, and distributed storage systems.

## Repository Contents

- **Theory Documentation:**  
  Detailed explanation of the Slepian-Wolf theorem and the achievable rate region.
